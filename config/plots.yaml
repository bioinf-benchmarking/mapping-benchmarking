# plot_typoes define different type of plots
# they only describe the structure of the plot, not what values are used for the variables
# a plot tyope has:
# type: line/bar
# x_axis, y_axis, category_variable:
#   each of these should be either a result_type or a parameter_type

plot_types:
  f1_score_bar:
    type: "bar"
    x: "method"
    y: "f1_score"
  accuracy:
    type: "scatter_and_line"
    x: "one_minus_precision"
    y: "recall"
    labels: "min_mapq"
    color: "method"
  accuracy_facet:
    type: "scatter_and_line"
    x: "one_minus_precision"
    y: "recall"
    labels: "min_mapq"
    color: "method"
    facet_col: "read_length"
  accuracy_vs_read_length_single_method:
    type: "line"
    x: "read_length"
    y: "f1_score"
  accuracy_vs_read_length:
    type: "line"
    x: "read_length"
    y: "f1_score"
    color: "method"
    facet_col: "variant_filter"

    # x_axis is by default methods if not specified

# A plot type can then be used to generate a plot with specified values specified by path:
# reports/plots/accuracy/... config matching read config but can contain variable groups ...
# example:
# reports/plots/accuracy/hg38/hg002/small/whole_genome_single_end/low_error/150/1000/all_methods/4/plot.png
# all_methods is here a variable group. An accuracy plot will then be generated with methods specified by all_methods
# example with read length as a group:
# reports/plots/accuracy_vs_read_length/hg38/hg002/small/whole_genome_single_end/low_error/read_lengths_rough/1000/all_methods/4/plot.png
#
# In the last example, the engine knows that accuracy_vs_read_length will need that read_length is a parameter_group with parameter_type read_length
# since the x_axis is read_length. Similarily, since category_variable is "method", it will ned a method parameter_group
# it will then generate a plot with those methods as category variable and the read lengths as x_axis
#
# bar plot of f1 score for reads with variant and min mapq 5

# Configuration for "genomes" (individuals) that reads can be sequenced from
# Genomes are based on a reference genome
# each reference genome can have multiple individuals
